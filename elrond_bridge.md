# Open Grant Proposal

- **Project Name:** XP.network Substrate Parachain - Elrond Cross-Chain Communication Bridge (CCCB).
- **Team Name:** XP.network.
- **Payment Address:** BTC: bc1qdpx2e6lejre536ph0csskas888ua3pz5p4pkuj.

## Project Overview

### Overview

XP.network is a codeless platform for building blockchain agnostic NFT DApps. XP.network allows non-developers to build their NFT marketplaces, galleries, museums and many more use-cases without coding. We will connect our users's applications to different blockchains via Polkadot.

In this project, we aim to bring Elrond’s users and ecosystem to Polkadot.

### Project Details

The main product of the project is a Cross-Chain Communication Bridge (CCCB) for two non-identical unsynchronized blockchains A (Substrate Parachain) and B (Elrond).

#### The structure of the CCCB:
##### 1. A Substrate pallet implementing the following functionality:
  + Fungible liquidity freezing  for a Parachain native token.
  + Non-fungible liquidity freezing.
  + Fungible liquidity release to an arbitrary account (wrapped eGold).
  + Non-fungible liquidity release to an arbitrary account.
  + Support of cross-chain RPC with an arbitrary number of arguments.
  + Bridge relay validator subscription mechanism implementation.
  + BFT consensus mechanism implementation.
#### 2. Relay validator/prover written in TypeScript. Supplied in a docker container.
#### 3. “Freezer” smart contract written in Rust deployable on Elrond blockchain.
  + Fungible liquidity freezing (eGold).
  + Non-fungible liquidity freezing.
#### 4. “Minter” smart contract written in Rust deployable on Elrond blockchain.
  + Fungible liquidity release to an arbitrary account (wrapped Parachain native token)
  + Non-fungible liquidity release to an arbitrary account.
  + Support of cross-chain RPC with an arbitrary number of arguments.
  + Bridge relay validator subscription.
  + BFT consensus mechanism.


Notes:
At the moment, Elrond has not implemented smart contract event emission, therefore our smart contract will store the transaction related events in its storage. Our validators will be requesting whether the data has changed in the smart contract in a loop with the 6 sec. delay (round length) for a fixed number of rounds. Once Elrond implements proper event emission (approximately in 2-3 months), we will use the native flow, since it will be faster and more efficient.


### Ecosystem Fit

  + Users will be able to transfer their liquidity or NFTs from any Substrate parachain to Elrond and backwards once they attach the XP.network pallet to their parachain or parathread.
  + Substrate parachain smart contracts will be able to call smart contracts functions in Elrond and backwards with an arbitrary number of arguments via or relay validators.

## Future Plans

+ We will develop a DEX between the coins of the Substrate Parachains to Elrond and back.
+ We will make the relay validators completely decentralized, implementing the PoS consensus mechanism.
