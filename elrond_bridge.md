# Open Grant Proposal

- **Project Name:** Substrate Parachain - Elrond Cross-chain Bridge (SPEC-B)
- **Team Name:** XP.network
- **Payment Address:** BTC: bc1qdpx2e6lejre536ph0csskas888ua3pz5p4pkuj

## Project Overview

### Overview

XP.network is a blockchain-agnostic platform for building NFT DApps. With XP.network, even non-developers can create NFT marketplaces, galleries, lending apps, and more - without a single line of code and on any blockchain, thanks to the interoperability features of Polkadot.

In this project, we aim to bring Elrond users and the ecosystem to Polkadot.

### SPEC-B UI

The bridge is accompanied by intuitive UI:

### Project Details

The proposed Substrate Parachain - Elrond Cross-chain Bridge (SPEC-B) will link the two non-identical unsynchronized blockchains, allowing liquidity transfers.

### Use-cases

![img](https://github.com/xp-network/w3f_application/blob/main/XP-Elrond%20bridge-1.png)

+ Liquidity transfer from an account in a substrate Parachain to Elrond or from Elrond to a Parachain.
+ Selling or purchasing Parachain based NFTs by an account holder in Elrond or vice versa.
+ Cross-chain games with RPC-connected smart contracts.
+ Lending or borrowing eGold, sovereign Parachain coins, or other liquidity.
+ Cross-chain NFT smart contracts with royalties.
+ Cross-chain insurances.

#### SPEC-B Structure:
#### 1. A Substrate pallet implementing the following functionality:
  + Fungible token transfer
    ```rust
    /// Transfer to elrond chain event
    /// validators must subscribe to this
    pub struct Transfer {
        action_id: u128,
        to: String,
        value: Balance
    }
    ```
  + Fungible liquidity freezing </br>
    Sovereign parachain tokens as well as wrapped eGold are locked in the pallet to avoid duplication during the transfer.
    Currently implemented in the "Freezer" smart contract in Ink! Will be implemented in Rust as a part of the pallet.
    ```rust
    ///TODO: implement in Milestone 1
    ```
  + Fungible liquidity release </br>
    A transferred number of wrapped eGold or Parachain native tokens can be released to an arbitrary account in the target parachain.
    ```rust
        /// unfreeze tokens and send them to an address
        /// only validators can call this
        pub fn pop(&mut self, action_id: String, to: AccountId, value: Balance) {
            self.verify_action(action_id, Action::Unfreeze { to, value })
        }
  
  + Non-fungible liquidity freezing </br>
    NFTs are locked in the pallet to avoid duplication.
    Currently implemented in the "Freezer" smart contract in Ink! Will be implemented in Rust as a part of the pallet.
    ```rust
    ///TODO: implement in Milestone 1
    ```
  + Non-fungible liquidity release to an arbitrary account </br>
    Wrapped NFTs alongside their data can be released to a designated account in the target parachain.
    ```rust
    ///TODO: implement in Milestone 1
    ```
  + Support of cross-chain RPC with an arbitrary number of arguments </br>
    A remote procedure call can be executed via the pallet. The call will contain the following parameters:
    ```rust
      pub struct ScCall {
        action_id:  u128,         // Unique action identifier
        to:         String,       // smart contract address in a parachain
        endpoint:   String,       // smart contract function name
        args:       Vec<Vec<u8>>  // Target smart contract function arguments
    }
    ```
  + Bridge relay validator subscription mechanism implementation </br>
    This mechanism allows dynamically to add new validators in a decentralized way after the system launch.
    ```rust
        /// Subscribe to events & become a validator
        pub fn subscribe(&mut self) {
            ...
        }
    ```
  + BFT consensus mechanism implementation </br>
    A blockchain embedded smart contract checks whether 2/3 * n + 1 validators have signed the transaction, where **n** is the total number of validators.
    ```rust
    if validated == (2*validator_cnt/3)+1 {
                self.exec_action(act);
            }
    ```
  + Event emission </br>
    To signal the validators that one of the bridge-related events has occurred the pallet emits events with the accompanying data.
  ```rust
	/// Emit an SCCall event
	/// TODO: Replace the Ink! implementation with Rust in Milestone 1
	pub fn send_sc_call(&mut self, target_contract: String, endpoint: String, args: Vec<Vec<u8>>) {
	    bech32::decode(&target_contract).expect("Invalid address!");
	    ...
	    self.env().emit_event( ScCall {
		action_id: self.last_action,
		to: target_contract,
		endpoint,
		args
	    } )
	}
  ```
 + Runtime Storage defined by our module:</br>
 
	Locally scoped storage, accessible only from within the pallet will contain the following data:
 ```rust
// Subject to implementation change:
HashMap<AccountId, ()>,		// The set of the validators
HashMap<String, ActionInfo>,	// The hash map of the actions
last_action: u128
 ```
 
#### 2. Relay validator/prover written in TypeScript. Supplied in a docker container.
  Relay validators are very thin. They consist of the private and public keys and two local nodes one for listening/submitting to Elrond another for listening/submitting to a parachain with the attached bridge pallet. 
  
  
  **Stage 0: Centralized validators**</br>
  In the Alpha version of the bridge the validators are centralized, meaning our team completely controls all the validators.
  
  Since version B of the bridge we will implement a decentralized setting.

  Since both Substrate parachain and Elrond finalize blocks every 6 seconds we cannot use the PoW model, which, alongside unjustifiably heavy computation, requires significant time. Hence, we're left with the other models, such as:
  
**Stage 1: Proof-of-Authority (PoA)**</br>
Principle: a centralized network of trusted bodies backing the validator nodes with their reputation. A new validator is added or removed by a centralized body, the team of the project.

Challenges faced by reputation systems to be mitigated:</br>

1.The following attacks can be mitigated by a centralized assessment.</br>
**Sybil Attack** is when an attacker creates multiple identities to gain an unfair advantage over honest users who own a single identity.</br>
**Self-Promotion**, Ballot Stuffing happens when a user with multiple identities or a group of users promotes themselves by assigning themselves additional positive feedback after every interaction.</br>
**Slandering, Bad-Mouthing** is the act of sabotaging an honest user's reputation by assigning unfairly low feedback to ruin a competitor's reputation. Centralized reputation assessment is not vulnerable to such attacks.</br>
**Random Ratings** are when an attacker submits randomly generated feedback instead of providing an accurate evaluation of the peer's behavior.</br>
**Free Riding** is a situation when a user does not provide any feedback taking advantage of the system without providing any contribution.</br>

2. The following types of attack can be mitigated by viewing every new user as untrustworthy. A positive reputation must be built by consistent benevolent behavior over a long period of time.</br>

**Whitewashing** is when a user with a negative reputation quits the system and returns with a new identity and fresh reputation.</br>
**Oscillation** is when a user quickly builds a good reputation in several low-value transactions and then reverses its good behavior to malicious taking advantage of the mislead counterparts.</br>

#### Transaction Award
All the participating validators will be equally awarded a share of the transaction fee, calculated like so:</br>

TX<sub>award</sub> = TX<sub>fee</sub> / Val<sub>num</sub></br>

Where:</br>
**TX**<sub>award</sub> is the transaction fee share paid to a validator.</br>
**TX**<sub>fee</sub> is the total transaction fee earned by all the validators.</br>
**Val**<sub>num</sub> - is the total number of participating validators.</br>

While the transaction fee will be calculated as follows:

TX<sub>fee</sub> = bias + TX<sub>mul</sub> * size(TX<sub>bin</sub>)</br>

Where:</br>
**bias** is the fixed value of XPNET 0.001 - to avoid DoS attacks</br>
**TX**<sub>mul</sub> is the multiplyer equal to XPNET 0.005</br>
**size**(**TX**<sub>bin</sub>) is the binary size of the transaction code

Once the bridge matures and more entities will desire to become validators we will migrate from PoA to PoS bridge validators concensus mechanism.</br>

**Stage 2: Proof-of-Stake (PoS)**
Principle: the network trusts the validator, who puts its own resources as a pledge for the ability to create blocks: the larger the share, the higher the probability that the network will allow the creation of a block.

#### Transaction Award

The participating validators will be awarded the transaction fees on several conditions:</br>
1. A validator must respond fast enough to appear in the BFT treshold in the target blockchain (this measure stimulates the validators to use fast and highly efficient servers).
2. The transaction fee is divided between the validator in proportion of their stake (which stimulates the validators to stake more, making it more difficult to take the bridge over).
3. The validator's signature is taken into account if the minimum required bond is locked as a stake.

#### Decentralized Calculation of the Minimum Required Bond

Step 1: Calculating the average transaction award </br>

Motivation: An award of a random validator may differ from one or several other validators for reasons explained in other section of the present work. This could create a precedent, that sone validators will be required to stake less that the others. This could create a vulnerability of "very little at stake". Hence, the calculation of the average award is preferable over individual one, since some validators having staked too little and providing slow service may earn from little to nothing.

TX<sub>avg</sub> = TX<sub>fee</sub> / Val<sub>num</sub></br>

Where:</br>
**TX**<sub>avg</sub> is the average transaction fee for calculating the minimum required Stake.</br>
**TX**<sub>fee</sub> is the total transaction fee earned by all the validators.</br>
**Val**<sub>num</sub> - is the total number of participating validators.</br>
For example, there are 21 validators. They've earned XPNET 9485193841.</br>
The average share will be: TX<sub>avg</sub> = 9485193841 / 21 = XPNET 451,675,897.19</br>

Step 2: Calculating the minimum required bond: </br>

Motivation: We're assuming, that earning 20% of the staked amount is a fair deal. Hence, the Minimum stake formula:</br>

Minimum amount: XPNET worth to be locked as a stake equals the annual S<sub>min</sub> = TX<sub>avg</sub> * 5 * E<sub>num</sub>/365, where:</br>

Where:</br>
**S**<sub>min</sub> is the minimum required stake  to remain a validator</br>
**TX**<sub>avg</sub> is the average transaction fee for calculating the minimum required Stake.</br>
E<sub>num</sub> - is the number of epochs <=365 days in a year.</br>
For example, the bridge has been operating for 150 days and TX<sub>avg</sub> = 451,675,897.19</br>
S<sub>min</sub> = 451,675,897.19 * 5 * 150/365 = XPNET 928,101,158.61</br>

The "Elrond-Minter" smart contract will collect the approproate data in the following format: 
```rust
L = Vec<(TotalTxFee, [Validators; T])>
``` 
and will send it to the pallet once in an epoch.

To allow reasonable time for a validator, the grace period for locking the minimum amount will be 7 epochs since the notification. If a validator does not increase the required stake it will be suspended from the validators pool.

PoS Distribution in code:
![img](https://github.com/xp-network/w3f_application/blob/main/PoS%20structure.png)



Even though, there other protocols, such as Proof-of-Location (PoL), Proof-of-Elapsed Time (PoET), Proof-of-Authority (PoA), Proof-of-Burn (PoB), Proof-of-Capacity (PoC) / Proof-of-Space (PoS), Proof-of-Stake-Time (PoST), Proof-of-Brain (PoB), Proof-ofPhysical-Address (PoPA) / Proof-of-Bank-Account (PoBA), Proof-of-Concept (PoC) and some more, we consider PoS to be more mature and easy to implement. However, in the future we may add reputation and ranking to PoS to make the system more robust and resilient to attacks.

  
#### 3. “Elrond-Minter” smart contract written in Rust deployable on Elrond blockchain.
  + Transfer Liquidity
  ```rust
  Action::SendXP { to, amount, data } => {
	let token = self.token().get();
	self.send().esdt_local_mint(&token, &amount);
	Ok(PerformActionResult::SendXP(SendToken {
		api: self.send(),
		to,
		token: token.into(),
		amount,
		data
	}))
}
  ```
  + Fungible liquidity freezing </br>
    eGold or wrapped Parachain native tokens are locked to avoid duplication
  + Fungible liquidity release to an arbitrary account </br>
    Wrapped Parachain native tokens or eGold are released to an arbitrary target address in Elrond.
    ```rust
	#[payable("*")]
	#[endpoint(withdraw)]
	fn withdraw(&self, #[payment] value: Self::BigUint, #[payment_token] token: TokenIdentifier, to: String)  -> SCResult<Self::BigUint> {
		require!(value > 0, "Value must be > 0");
		require!(token == self.token().get(), "Invalid token!");

		self.send().esdt_local_burn(&token, &value);

		let ident = self.event_ident().update(|event| { 
			event.add_assign(Self::BigUint::from(1u64));
			event.clone()
		});
		self.event_mapper().insert(ident.clone(), EventInfo::new(Event::Unfreeze { to, value }));

		Ok(ident)
	}
    ```
  + Non-fungible liquidity freezing </br>
    NFTs are locked in the smart contract to avoid duplication.
    ```rust
    ///TODO: implement in Milestone 1
    ```
  + Non-fungible liquidity release to an arbitrary account </br>
  + ```rust
    ///TODO: implement in Milestone 1
    ```
  + Support of cross-chain RPC with an arbitrary number of arguments </br>
  A remote procedure call, made from a Substrate pallet, will be executed by a smart contract deployed on Elrond. The call will contain the following parameters:
    ```rust
    Action::SCCall {
		to,
		amount,
		endpoint,
		args
	} => {
		let mut contract_call_raw =
			ContractCall::<Self::SendApi, ()>::new(self.send(), to, endpoint)
				.with_token_transfer(TokenIdentifier::egld(), amount);
		for arg in args {
			contract_call_raw.push_argument_raw_bytes(arg.as_slice());
		}
		Ok(PerformActionResult::AsyncCall(
			contract_call_raw.async_call(),
		))
	}
    ```
  + Bridge relay validator subscription </br>
    This mechanism allows dynamically to add new validators in a decentralized way after the system launch.
    ```rust
	  /// Initiates board member addition process.
	  /// Can also be used to promote a proposer to board member.
	  #[endpoint(proposeAddValidator)]
	  fn propose_add_validator(&self, uuid: Self::BigUint, board_member_address: Address) -> SCResult<PerformActionResult<Self::SendApi>> {
		  self.validate_action(uuid, Action::AddValidator(board_member_address))
	  }
    ```
  + BFT consensus mechanism </br>
    A blockchain embedded smart contract waits for the BFT threshold to execute a required transaction.
    ```rust
            if validated == (2*validator_cnt/3)+1 {
                self.exec_action(act);
            }
    ```
  + Event emission </br>
    To signal the validators that one of the bridge-related events has occurred the smart contract emits events with the accompanying data.
    ```rust
    /// Event emission will be implemented by Elrond in ~ 2 months
    ```
### Ecosystem Fit

  + Substrate parachain users will be able to trade, exchange or transfer their tokens to and from Elrond with minimal effort and transaction fees. It will open a new market for the Polkadot community and will make the tokens of both the systems more liquid.
  + Substrate parachain smart contracts will be able to call smart contracts functions in Elrond with an arbitrary number of arguments via the bridge relay validators. The same will be possible from the side of Elrond.
  + Polkadot already has bridges to [Bitcoin](https://beta.polkabtc.io/), [Ethereum](https://snowbridge.snowfork.com/), Cosmos, [EOS](https://github.com/bifrost-finance/bifrost), [Ethereum Classic](https://github.com/ChainSafe/ChainBridge), etc., but there's no bridge to Elrond. This project will fill the gap.
