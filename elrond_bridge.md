# Open Grant Proposal

- **Project Name:** XP.network Substrate Parachain - Elrond Cross-Chain Communication Bridge (CCCB)
- **Team Name:** XP.network
- **Payment Address:** BTC: bc1qdpx2e6lejre536ph0csskas888ua3pz5p4pkuj

## Project Overview

### Overview

XP.network is a blockchain-agnostic platform for building NFT DApps. With XP.network, even non-developers can create NFT marketplaces, galleries, lending apps, and more - without a single line of code and on any blockchain, thanks to the interoperability features of Polkadot.

In this project, we aim to bring Elrond’s users and ecosystem to Polkadot.

### Project Details

The proposed Cross-Chain Communication Bridge(CCCB) will link a Substrate Parachain and Elrond which are two non-identical unsynchronized blockchain. Allowing liquidity transfers.

#### The structure of the CCCB:
##### 1. A Substrate pallet implementing the following functionality:
  + Fungible liquidity freezing  for a Parachain native token and wrapped eGold.
  + Fungible liquidity release to an arbitrary account of wrapped eGold or Parachain native token.
  + Non-fungible liquidity freezing.
  + Non-fungible liquidity release to an arbitrary account.
  + Support of cross-chain RPC with an arbitrary number of arguments.
  + Bridge relay validator subscription mechanism implementation.
  + BFT consensus mechanism implementation.
#### 2. Relay validator/prover written in TypeScript. Supplied in a docker container.
#### 3. “Elrond-Minter” smart contract written in Rust deployable on Elrond blockchain.
  + Fungible liquidity freezing (eGold or wrapped Parachain native tokens).
  + Non-fungible liquidity freezing.
  + Fungible liquidity release to an arbitrary account (wrapped Parachain native tokens or eGold)
  + Non-fungible liquidity release to an arbitrary account.
  + Support of cross-chain RPC with an arbitrary number of arguments.
  + Bridge relay validator subscription.
  + BFT consensus mechanism.


Notes:</br>
To avoid misunderstanding, it is important to say that there's no token exchange happenning in the bridge. For example, if a user transfers eGold the target account receives wrapped eGold and not a Parachain native token.

### Ecosystem Fit

  + Users will be able to transfer their liquidity or NFTs from any Substrate parachain to Elrond and backwards once they attach the XP.network pallet to their parachain or parathread.
  + Substrate parachain smart contracts will be able to call smart contracts functions in Elrond and backwards with an arbitrary number of arguments via or relay validators.

## Future Plans

+ We will develop a DEX between the coins of the Substrate Parachains to Elrond and back.
+ We will make the relay validators completely decentralized, implementing the PoS consensus mechanism.
