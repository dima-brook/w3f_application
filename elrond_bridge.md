# Open Grant Proposal

- **Project Name:** Substrate Parachain - Elrond Cross-chain Bridge (SPEC-B)
- **Team Name:** XP.network
- **Payment Address:** BTC: bc1qdpx2e6lejre536ph0csskas888ua3pz5p4pkuj

## Project Overview

### Overview

XP.network is a blockchain-agnostic platform for building NFT DApps. With XP.network, even non-developers can create NFT marketplaces, galleries, lending apps, and more - without a single line of code and on any blockchain, thanks to the interoperability features of Polkadot.

In this project, we aim to bring Elrond users and the ecosystem to Polkadot.

### SPEC-B UI

The bridge is accompanied by intuitive UI:

### Project Details

The proposed Substrate Parachain - Elrond Cross-chain Bridge (SPEC-B) will link the two non-identical unsynchronized blockchains, allowing liquidity transfers.

#### SPEC-B Structure:
#### 1. A Substrate pallet implementing the following functionality:
  + Fungible token transfer
    ```rust
    /// Transfer to elrond chain event
    /// validators must subscribe to this
    pub struct Transfer {
        action_id: u128,
        to: String,
        value: Balance
    }
    ```
  + Fungible liquidity freezing </br>
    Sovereign parachain tokens as well as wrapped eGold are locked in the pallet to avoid duplication during the transfer.
    ```rust
    ///TODO: implement in Milestone 1
    ```
  + Fungible liquidity release </br>
    A transferred number of wrapped eGold or Parachain native tokens can be released to an arbitrary account in the target parachain.
    ```rust
        /// unfreeze tokens and send them to an address
        /// only validators can call this
        pub fn pop(&mut self, action_id: String, to: AccountId, value: Balance) {
            self.verify_action(action_id, Action::Unfreeze { to, value })
        }
  
  + Non-fungible liquidity freezing </br>
    NFTs are locked in the pallet to avoid duplication.
    ```rust
    ///TODO: implement in Milestone 1
    ```
  + Non-fungible liquidity release to an arbitrary account </br>
    Wrapped NFTs alongside their data can be released to a designated account in the target parachain.
    ```rust
    ///TODO: implement in Milestone 1
    ```
  + Support of cross-chain RPC with an arbitrary number of arguments </br>
    A remote procedure call can be executed via the pallet. The call will contain the following parameters:
    ```rust
      pub struct ScCall {
        action_id:  u128,         // Unique action identifier
        to:         String,       // smart contract address in a parachain
        endpoint:   String,       // smart contract function name
        args:       Vec<Vec<u8>>  // Target smart contract function arguments
    }
    ```
  + Bridge relay validator subscription mechanism implementation </br>
    This mechanism allows to dynamically add new validators in a decentralized way after the system launch.
    ```rust
        /// Subscribe to events & become a validator
        pub fn subscribe(&mut self) {
            ...
        }
    ```
  + BFT consensus mechanism implementation </br>
    A blockchain embedded smart contract checks whether 2/3 * n + 1 validator have signed the transaction, where **n** is the total number of validators.
    ```rust
    if validated == (2*validator_cnt/3)+1 {
                self.exec_action(act);
            }
    ```
  + Event emission </br>
    To signal the validators that one of the bridge-related events has occurred the pallet emits events with the accompanying data.
  ```rust
	/// Emit an SCCall event
	/// TODO: Replace the Ink! implementation with Rust in Milestone 1
	pub fn send_sc_call(&mut self, target_contract: String, endpoint: String, args: Vec<Vec<u8>>) {
	    bech32::decode(&target_contract).expect("Invalid address!");
	    ...
	    self.env().emit_event( ScCall {
		action_id: self.last_action,
		to: target_contract,
		endpoint,
		args
	    } )
	}
  ```
 + Runtime Storage defined by our module:</br>
 
	Locally scoped storage, accessable only from within the pallet will contain the following data:
 ```rust
// Subject to implementation change:
HashMap<AccountId, ()>,		// The set of the validators
HashMap<String, ActionInfo>,	// The hash map of the actions
last_action: u128
 ```
 
#### 2. Relay validator/prover written in TypeScript. Supplied in a docker container.
  Relay validators are very thin. They consist of the private and public keys and two local nodes one for listening/submitting to Elrond another for listening/submitting to a parachain with the attached bridge pallet. 
  
  The trustworthiness of a validator is secured by the **Proof-of-Authority** (PoA) system. Alongside with the Proof-of-Stake validator selection mechanism, reputation of the validator is taken into account. A validator **reputation** is _aggregated from the feedback of the raters_, who evaluate the validators' behavior. 
  
![img](https://github.com/xp-network/w3f_application/blob/main/Reputation%20System%20Choice.png)
  
Challenges faced by reputation systems to be mitigated:

a.The following attacks can be mitigated by a centralized assessment.</br></br>
**Sybil Attack** is when an attacker creates multiple identities to gain an unfair advantage over honest users who own a single identity.</br>
**Self-Promotion, Ballot Stuffing** happens when a user with multiple identities or a group of users promote themselves by assigning themselves additional positive feedback after every interaction.</br>
**Slandering, Bad-Mouthing** is the act of sabotaging an honest user's reputation by assigning unfairly low feedback to ruin a competitor's reputation. Centralized reputation assessment is not vulnerable to such attacks.</br>
**Random Ratings** is when an attacker submits randomly generated feedback instead of providing an accurate evaluation of the peer's behavior.</br>
**Free Riding** is a situation when a user does not provide any feedback taking advantage of the system without providing any contribution.</br>
</br>
b. The following types of attack can be mitigated by viewing every new user as untrustworthy. A positive reputation must be built by consistent benevolent behavior over a long period of time.</br></br>
**Whitewashing** is when a user with a negative reputation quits the system and returns with a new identity and fresh reputation.</br>
**Oscillation** is when a user quickly builds a good reputation in several low-value transactions and then reverses its good behavior to malicious taking advantage of the mislead counterparts.</br>

  
#### 3. “Elrond-Minter” smart contract written in Rust deployable on Elrond blockchain.
  + Transfer Liquidity
  ```rust
  Action::SendXP { to, amount, data } => {
	let token = self.token().get();
	self.send().esdt_local_mint(&token, &amount);
	Ok(PerformActionResult::SendXP(SendToken {
		api: self.send(),
		to,
		token: token.into(),
		amount,
		data
	}))
}
  ```
  + Fungible liquidity freezing </br>
    eGold or wrapped Parachain native tokens are locked to avoid duplication
  + Fungible liquidity release to an arbitrary account </br>
    Wrapped Parachain native tokens or eGold are released to an arbitrary target address in Elrond.
    ```rust
	#[payable("*")]
	#[endpoint(withdraw)]
	fn withdraw(&self, #[payment] value: Self::BigUint, #[payment_token] token: TokenIdentifier, to: String)  -> SCResult<Self::BigUint> {
		require!(value > 0, "Value must be > 0");
		require!(token == self.token().get(), "Invalid token!");

		self.send().esdt_local_burn(&token, &value);

		let ident = self.event_ident().update(|event| { 
			event.add_assign(Self::BigUint::from(1u64));
			event.clone()
		});
		self.event_mapper().insert(ident.clone(), EventInfo::new(Event::Unfreeze { to, value }));

		Ok(ident)
	}
    ```
  + Non-fungible liquidity freezing </br>
    NFTs are locked in the smart contract to avoid duplication.
    ```rust
    ///TODO: implement in Milestone 1
    ```
  + Non-fungible liquidity release to an arbitrary account </br>
  + ```rust
    ///TODO: implement in Milestone 1
    ```
  + Support of cross-chain RPC with an arbitrary number of arguments </br>
  A remote procedure call can be executed via the pallet. The call will contain the following parameters:
    ```rust
    Action::SCCall {
		to,
		amount,
		endpoint,
		args
	} => {
		let mut contract_call_raw =
			ContractCall::<Self::SendApi, ()>::new(self.send(), to, endpoint)
				.with_token_transfer(TokenIdentifier::egld(), amount);
		for arg in args {
			contract_call_raw.push_argument_raw_bytes(arg.as_slice());
		}
		Ok(PerformActionResult::AsyncCall(
			contract_call_raw.async_call(),
		))
	}
    ```
  + Bridge relay validator subscription </br>
    This mechanism allows to dynamically add new validators in a decentralized way after the system launch.
    ```rust
	  /// Initiates board member addition process.
	  /// Can also be used to promote a proposer to board member.
	  #[endpoint(proposeAddValidator)]
	  fn propose_add_validator(&self, uuid: Self::BigUint, board_member_address: Address) -> SCResult<PerformActionResult<Self::SendApi>> {
		  self.validate_action(uuid, Action::AddValidator(board_member_address))
	  }
    ```
  + BFT consensus mechanism </br>
    A blockchain embedded smart contract checks whether 2/3 * n + 1 validator have signed the transaction, where **n** is the total number of validators.
    ```rust
            if validated == (2*validator_cnt/3)+1 {
                self.exec_action(act);
            }
    ```
  + Event emission </br>
    To signal the validators that one of the bridge-related events has occurred the smart contract emits events with the accompanying data.
    ```rust
    /// Event emission will be implemented by Elrond in ~ 2 months
    ```
### Ecosystem Fit

  + Users will be able to transfer their fungible liquidity or NFTs from any Substrate parachain to Elrond and backward once they attach the XP.network pallet to their parachain or parathread.
  + Substrate parachain smart contracts will be able to call smart contracts functions in Elrond with an arbitrary number of arguments via the bridge relay validators. The same will be possible from the side of Elrond.
  + Polkadot already has bridges to [Bitcoin](https://beta.polkabtc.io/), [Ethereum](https://snowbridge.snowfork.com/), Cosmos, [EOS](https://github.com/bifrost-finance/bifrost), [Ethereum Classic and ](https://github.com/ChainSafe/ChainBridge), etc., but there's no bridge to Elrond. This project will fill the gap.

### Use-cases
