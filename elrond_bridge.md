# Open Grant Proposal

- **Project Name:** Substrate Parachain - Elrond Cross-chain Bridge (SPEC-B)
- **Team Name:** XP.network
- **Payment Address:** BTC: bc1qdpx2e6lejre536ph0csskas888ua3pz5p4pkuj

## Project Overview

### Overview

XP.network is a blockchain-agnostic platform for building NFT DApps. With XP.network, even non-developers can create NFT marketplaces, galleries, lending apps, and more - without a single line of code and on any blockchain, thanks to the interoperability features of Polkadot.

In this project, we aim to bring Elrond users and the ecosystem to Polkadot.

### SPEC-B UI

The bridge is accompanied by intuitive UI:

### Ecosystem Fit

  + Users will be able to transfer their fungible liquidity or NFTs from any Substrate parachain to Elrond and backward once they attach the XP.network pallet to their parachain or parathread.
  + Substrate parachain smart contracts will be able to call smart contracts functions in Elrond with an arbitrary number of arguments via the bridge relay validators. The same will be possible from the side of Elrond.

### Project Details

The proposed Substrate Parachain - Elrond Cross-chain Bridge (SPEC-B) will link the two non-identical unsynchronized blockchains, allowing liquidity transfers.

#### SPEC-B Structure:
#### 1. A Substrate pallet implementing the following functionality:
  + Fungible liquidity freezing </br>
    Sovereign parachain tokens as well wrapped eGold are locked in the pallet to avoid duplication during the transfer.
  + Fungible liquidity release </br>
    A transferred number of wrapped eGold or Parachain native tokens can be released to an arbitrary account in the target parachain.
  + Non-fungible liquidity freezing </br>
    NFTs are locked in the pallet to avoid duplication.
  + Non-fungible liquidity release to an arbitrary account </br>
    Wrapped NFTs alongside their data can be released to a designated account in the target parachain.
  + Support of cross-chain RPC with an arbitrary number of arguments </br>
    A remote procedure call can be executed via the pallet. The call will contain the following parameters:
    ```rust
    {
      sc: string,                       // the address of the target smart contract
      func: string,                     // target function name
      args: Vec<Vec<uint8>>             // An arbitrary number of arguments of arbitrary types
    }
    ```
  + Bridge relay validator subscription mechanism implementation </br>
    This mechanism allows to dynamically add new validators in a decentralized way after the system launch.
  + BFT consensus mechanism implementation </br>
    A blockchain embedded smart contract checks whether 2/3 * n + 1 validator have signed the transaction, where **n** is the total number of validators.
  + Event emission </br>
    To signal the validators that one of the bridge-related events has occurred the pallet emits events with the accompanying data.
#### 2. Relay validator/prover written in TypeScript. Supplied in a docker container.
  Relay validators are very thin. They consist of the private and public keys and two local nodes one for listening/submitting to Elrond another for listening/submitting to a parachain with the attached bridge pallet. 
#### 3. “Elrond-Minter” smart contract written in Rust deployable on Elrond blockchain.
  + Fungible liquidity freezing </br>
    eGold or wrapped Parachain native tokens are locked to avoid duplication
  + Fungible liquidity release to an arbitrary account </br>
    Wrapped Parachain native tokens or eGold are released to an arbitrary target address in Elrond.
  + Non-fungible liquidity freezing </br>
    NFTs are locked in the smart contract to avoid duplication.
  + Non-fungible liquidity release to an arbitrary account </br>
  + Support of cross-chain RPC with an arbitrary number of arguments </br>
  A remote procedure call can be executed via the pallet. The call will contain the following parameters:
    ```rust
    {
      sc: string,                       // the address of the target smart contract
      func: string,                     // target function name
      args: Vec<Vec<uint8>>             // An arbitrary number of arguments of arbitrary types
    }
    ```
  + Bridge relay validator subscription </br>
    This mechanism allows to dynamically add new validators in a decentralized way after the system launch.
  + BFT consensus mechanism </br>
    A blockchain embedded smart contract checks whether 2/3 * n + 1 validator have signed the transaction, where **n** is the total number of validators.
  + Event emission </br>
    To signal the validators that one of the bridge-related events has occurred the smart contract emits events with the accompanying data.

### Use-cases

![img](https://github.com/xp-network/w3f_application/blob/main/Use-case.png)

+ Liquidity transfer from an account in a substrate Parachain to Elrond or from Elrond to a Parachain.
+ Selling or purchasing Parachain based NFTs by an account holder in Elrond or vice versa.
+ Cross-chain games with RPC-connected smart contracts.
+ Lending or borrowing eGold, sovereign Parachain coins, or other liquidity.
+ Cross-chain NFT smart contracts with royalties.
+ Cross-chain insurances.
