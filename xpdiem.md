## Project Overview

### Overview

XPDiem aims to build a platform which allows to build NFT based applications on Diem blockchain and connect the resulting applications to Polkadot. This platform will enable artists, musicians, celebrities, game developers and other content providers to create personal online NFT marketplaces without writing code.

Diem's development team crafted the Move language for smart contract creation. By contrast with Ethereum's smart contracts, data and potentially reusable code are splitted into resources and modules respectively, giving it additional security and flexibility. However, the Move language is currently not very popular. Its documentation can be vague or missing when covering some topics. It's standard library is very basic and short. NFT creation protocols are not implemented.

We are aspiring to create an automated toolbox that will generate valid code in Move, which could be further validated and compiled to byte-code and interact with the Diem blockchain. We will write the currently nonexistent libraries for NFT creation in Move, meeting the ERC-721 and ERC-1155 standards.

Connection to Polkadot will be implemented via Pontem's Move palette, where our autogenerated code in Move will run natively. All the applications produced by our platform will use this protocol to address this Polkadot Parathread.

### Project Details

Let's discuss the "building blocks" of the XPDiem platform one by one.

1. Smart Contract Editor - a UI written in React that generates "intentions" and collects user data for passing them to the next module.
2. Move VM Compiler - a modified version of Diem's Move VM written in Rust. The modification includes ability not only to read, validate and compile code in Move, but also to generate it from the "intentions" coming from the UI. It will also include our libraries for NFT generation.
3. Compliance Validator - a QA tool both for the Smart Contract Editor in TypeScript and the Move-VM Compiler in Rust.
4. Polkadot Move palette - a Polkadot Parathread that allows to publish Move modules and execute scripts.
5. Application builder - a UI for building SEO optimized, swift and secure NFT based websites, packing all the above technologies into a production ready application.
6. XPDiem Test-net - a Kusama parathread for testing the platform generated applications interactions with other blockchains.
7. Documentation and tutorials for the platform users.

### Ecosystem Fit

- Non developers will create personal NFT marketplaces on Diem blockchain, connected to Polkadot.
- XPDiem experimental network will work as a Kusama Parathread. 
- Potentially the Polkadot Adapter can develop to become programming language independent.
