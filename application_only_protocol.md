## Project Overview

### Overview

XP.network is a codeless platform for building blockchain agnostic NFT DApps. XP.network allows non-developers to build their NFT marketplaces, galleries, museums and many more use-cases without coding. We will connect our users's applications to different blockchains via Polkadot.

In order to synchronize communication between different [parachains](https://research.web3.foundation/en/latest/polkadot/XCMP/index.html) we want to build our own protocol which will be used by a network of XP.network pallets, that can be attached to and be used by any parachain.

Since, using the current XCMP protocol, it is hard to trace whether an incoming message is related to any previous transaction or request, we will elaborate a protocol that will enable such tracking by the "TopicId", which is especially useful when multiple transactions(TXs) are executed between two blockchains (Lx, Ly). Besides, when a message is sent from one parachain to another the initiating parachain is not kept updated about the progress of a transaction, while our protocol will take care of that. The XP.network Relay Chain protocol will be supported by a group of pallets, each acting like a “post office” in a post office network.

#### Integration

Any parachain, parathread or bridge can attach our pallet and use its functionality. The pallets will act as a “post office network” supporting the protocol that enables nodes to keep track of the “TopicIds”. Each "TopicId" represents one negotiated transaxtion (TX) between two parachains (Lx, Ly).

### Project Details

The project is comprised of 2 interdependant deliverables:

1. The XP.network Relay Chain Protocol, which will enable parachains to communicate keeping track of the state change of every transaction with the TopicId.

2. A Substrate Pallet implementing the XP.network Relay Chain protocol.


**XP Relay Chain Protocol** will be supported by a number of pallets, each acting as a “post office” for its parathread. A typical message will include:
```terminal
{
ID:                 id,               //required to identify that the other blockchain’s reply is related to this request,
To:                 dest,             // indicates the destination parachain / parathread,
Payload:            blob              // A binary representation of the "intention"
}
```

The runtime [storage](https://substrate.dev/rustdocs/v3.0.0/frame_support/storage/trait.StorageValue.html#required-methods) & the message inside the binary payload will be structured as follows:

![img](https://github.com/xp-network/w3f_application/blob/main/xp.network%20blob.png)

The **XP.network Decision Tree**, regulating the eficiency of the data flow between the two pallets, will roughly look like this:

![img](https://github.com/xp-network/w3f_application/blob/main/XP.network%20Protocol-2.png)

The above scheme is a work in progress and subject to change.

Apart from standard setup, a pallet implementing XP.network Relay Chain Protocol consists of:

1. **Message Listener** - it listens to the incomming messages and passes them to the Decision Tree.
2. **Message Deserialiser** - it reads the contents of the binary file and populates the fields of the Message struct.
3. **Message Serialiser** - it packs the values of the Message struct into a binary representation.
4. **Message Sender** - it uses the Relay Chain callback mechanism to communicate with the other parachains and parathreads using XP Network protocol.
5. **Runtime Storage** - it stores the binaries with the current state of the corresponding transaction. Each blob can be accessed like so: ```sender[TopicId]```.
6. **Decsision Tree** - it controlls the eficiency of the data flow between the pallets.

#### The XP.network Relay Chain protocol is not:

This protocol is by no means a bridge between the blockchains. However, we have plans of building bridges to a number of blockchains in further projects.

#### Further development

We may add more flags to reflect more states of the negotiated transaction, for example, we can specify the reasons of rejection in the target blockchain, for example, due to lack of gas.

### Ecosystem Fit

- The XP.network protocol allows parachains to communicate in a connectionless but ordered and reliable way. The protocol allows to store the State of the negotiated TX and enables the functionality required to inform the User accordingly.

- All it takes is to attach the XP.network pallet to a parachain.
